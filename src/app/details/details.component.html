<h1>Details</h1>
<div>
  <p>This is the details pag of my simple application. It was the second page added and allowed me to mess around with the concept of angular routing.
    I was able to set up the nav bar to have a link between the two pages as well as have the routing component showing off the componet I want to see using the router tags.
    This was exciting and interesting and now I have more than one page on my web app.
